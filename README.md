## Overview
I'm self-hosting several services on two Raspberry Pi's and one Dell Latitude 7490 to improve my digital sovereignty and reduce third-party costs. My setup previously used standalone Docker agents running Docker Compose stacks, but now I'm teaching myself orchestration using k3s to add some measure of self-healing and redundancy.

## Goals
- Photo storage
- File storage
- VPN server
- DNS server + sinkhole
- Dashboard

## Constraints
The Raspberry Pi 3 uses an SD card for system storage, so it is unsuitable as a distributed filesystem host

The architecture mismatch between the Raspberry Pis (ARM 64) and the laptop (AMD64) necessitate multi-architecture container images or use of deployment constraints

## Tools
- k3s for container orchestration
- Git for version control
